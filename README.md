# my_herbs_app
This is an application I built that uses published research on terpenes, the organic compounds that determine the different strains and effects of cannabis. Certain terpenes have been researched to help with different mental and physical illnesses, so myHerbs simply asks the users relevant questions, and based on those answers, determines which combination of terpenes (and therefore which strain of cannabis) is best suited to assist in users ailments. User data is stored in Firebase. All research and software developing was done by me.

This is the first project I ever did on my own, and all software knowledge was self-taught online. Bear in mind, some code may be ugly and not optimized. Comments and advice on possible updates are always welcome.
